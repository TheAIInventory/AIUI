# AIUI


Take control of your computer without touching a mouse or keyboard. AIUI uses advanced computer vision and hand tracking to let you move the cursor, click, swipe, zoom, and manipulate windows—all with natural hand gestures captured by your webcam. Experience futuristic, touchless interaction inspired by Vision Pro and Iron Man’s holographic UIs. Say goodbye to peripherals and hello to the future of intuitive computing.
